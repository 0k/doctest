* Adding =@0k/doctest= to your project

From the root of your project:

#+begin_src sh
npm install --save @0k/doctest
#+end_src

Or better, as =@0k/doctest= is still in early release,

#+begin_src sh
npm install --save @0k/doctest#master
#+end_src

To be sure to get the latest version, relaunch this last command
whenever you want to update.

* Contributing to =@0k/doctest=

This package is using ~npm~ to track dependendies, so you can install them
with:

   #+begin_src sh
   npm install
   #+end_src

As this package is written in =typescript=. You can transpile to
=javascript= and transpile on file change with:

   #+begin_src sh
   ## Compile and watch
   npx tspc -w
   #+end_src

Tests are managed through =vitest=


   #+begin_src sh
   ## Run test once
   npm run test
   #+end_src

Note that you can also use ~npx vitest~ command to launch tests in
watch mode.
